# CSCI2270 Final Project

# Project Summary

This project is going to...
Take information about the characters from the videogame, Super Smash Bros. 4
and organize the data into one or two data structures. It will store information
about the character's background as well as their moves. It will have the name
of the moves and how to execute them. The user will be able to look through the
data structure to find a specific character's information including the moves
and his/her background info. This will be done by dumping all the information
into a text file and then parse through it to extract all the pieces of data
which I will actually use to create the Binary Search Tree.
